# LPG-Leakage-Detector-without-using-Microcontroller
Developed an LPG leakage detector using dual comparator, LM7805 regulator, TIP122 transistor, and MQ6 sensor. The system triggers an alert when gas exceeds a threshold, providing a low-cost, reliable safety solution adaptable for households to prevent potential hazards.
